# Product Context: Roast My Spotify

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Malaysian Spotify users lack culturally relevant entertainment that combines their music taste with local humor. Generic music analysis tools miss the cultural nuances that make Malaysian comedy authentic and relatable.

### Cultural Gap

- Existing music analysis tools use generic Western humor
- No platforms celebrate Malaysian cultural identity through music
- Limited AI applications that understand Malaysian slang and context
- Music recommendation apps lack the playful roasting element

### Solution Vision

Create an AI-powered platform that celebrates Malaysian culture through music roasting, combining:

- Authentic Malaysian humor and slang
- Spotify's rich music data
- Claude 3 Haiku's advanced language capabilities
- Cultural pride and local identity

## How It Should Work

### User Journey

1. **Discovery**: User finds the app through social sharing or Malaysian tech communities
2. **Input**: User pastes their Spotify playlist URL into a simple, prominent input field
3. **Processing**: AI analyzes playlist with Malaysian cultural context
4. **Entertainment**: User receives a hilarious, culturally authentic roast
5. **Sharing**: User can share roast on social media or view others' roasts

### Core Experience Principles

- **Instant Gratification**: Fast roast generation (under 3 seconds)
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Real Malaysian slang, not forced or fake
- **Shareable Content**: Roasts designed for social media sharing
